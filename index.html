            <p class="lead"> We are motivated to provide quick support for women and children in need. Our designs provide quickly accessible information for those who don't have much time to read through the website. We believe this is essential to people in abusive homes due to the tension in the house, we want to provide a form of relief and support by showing all options clearly. Our inspiration rises from the impact a simple design can make and how it can change people's lives.

<h1>Research</h1>
<h2> With our limitations we researched heavily on domestic violence. We learned only 18% of women speak out. We wanted to be able to connect women who survived this type of trauma to women going through it now. Getting more insight, we also found more information on how controlling a violent home can be. Including the clear history and leave site options provides safety to users who many need it.</h2>

    <h1>Definition</h1>
    <h2>Learning about the perspective of ours users we understood some may be in distress when using the website. We decided to use a royal color purple for its strong and calming nature, decreasing any excessive usage of violent colors like red or black. Adding encouraging words to help the user feel more empowered and in control, knowing there is a variety of help not only police.
     This was all done In hopes to increase the percentage of women to speak out.
    </h2>

    <h1>Ideation</h1>
    <h2>The structure of the website was strongly based on the safety of some users. This included the 'leave site' button following the user as they scroll through the mobile/desktop view, in case at any moment the user can exit safely. Also encouraging words were added through out the navigation to help empower abused women to speak out against their attackers. Over all, this site was made simple and direct for both donation and getting help to the domestic violence non-profit organization of The Redwood.</h2>
